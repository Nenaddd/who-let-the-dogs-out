## Instructions
The development server can be run locally using NPM. This allows testing of the application's code locally.

No dependencies (other than [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)) are required on the host PC.

## Building and Running the Local Development Server
1. Ensure that Node.js is install on the host PC (or Mac) - Supported version is 10.16.x but others might also work
2. In the terminal, go to root folder of the source (the folder containing this readme)
3. Run the following command from the terminal in order to install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm-install
```
4. Wait a few seconds
5. To start the development server, run the following command:
```
npm start
```
6. Wait for the server to start

You should now be able to see the application running (at localhost:3000)

## Creating a Production Build
1. Running 'npm run build' creates a build directory with a production build of your app

## Testing the App
